# Clemgame python

Hi!!! I'm testing some stuff for a game here.

If you want to run it, please follow [this gude](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/start-your-journey/downloading-files-from-github) to download the code. If you know how to clone it with [git](https://git-scm.com/download/win), do that preferably.

Since I'm assuming you're new to working with python, I've created two scripts that'll create your virtual enviroment for this.

### 1. Install needed software
This project was made with [**Python 3.11.3**](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and [**VS Code**](https://code.visualstudio.com/). Python is *required* while VS Code is *optional*. For a gude on installing python, see the following;

- [Windows](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/python/beginners)
- [Mac OS](https://docs.python.org/3/using/mac.html)
- [Linux (Ubuntu)](https://www.knowledgehut.com/blog/data-science/install-python-on-ubuntu)

### 2. Run the begin script
The "begin" script will get you started off. The command to run it is different on linux and windows.

**Windows**
Run the following commands;

- `cd (project directory)`
- `./begin.ps1`
  
**Linux**
Run the following commands

- `cd (project directory)`
- `chmod +x ./begin.sh`
- `./begin.sh`

### 3. Run the [main.py](./main.py) script

The following command will run the main.py script;
`python ./main.py`

### (Optional) 4. Deactive the virtual environment
When you run begin.sh, you are creating a virtual enviroment. When you are done with the script, run the `deactivate` command. Repeat step 2 once you've done this.
